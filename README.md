# ASCT+B Generator

This program converts a simple TSV file into a HuBMAP ASCT+B table.

The included file "demo-input.txt" was generated by Excel using the "demo-input.xlsx" file (Save As "Tab delimited Text"). The generated output is a TSV file. The example file "demo-output.xls" was generated by the program.

## Version

Feb 15, 2022: 

- Test to be sure entities (anatomical structures, cell types, biomarkers and references) don't have commas in their names. 

- Added a command line argument users can set to force anatomical structures to be unique (ie., each has one and only one parent). When set, if the same sub-structure exists in multiple parent-structures, then each child structure would need to be uniquely named. By default, a child structure can have multiple parent structures.
- Added a command line argument users can set to cause the program to automatically create missing features, when features are used. For example, if a biomarker is assigned to a cell type, by default, the biomarker must be independently defined but now users can optionally disable this requirement. Anatomical structures must always be defined.

**v1.0** - Feb 14, 2022: Removed the (erroneous) assumption that an anatomical structure can only have a single parent, added more validation of the inputs, added debugging output options, and better handle command line arguments. Also various bug fixes.

**v1.0-beta** - Feb 11, 2022: This is a complete rewrite of the program. This version has none of the limitations from the alpha version, it includes more data validation, and requires less user intervention. 

**v0.1-alpha** - Feb 2, 2022: This is a proof of concept and not meant for production use.

## Differences

These are the significant differences from version v0.1-alpha and v1.0.
  1. The command line arguments have been greatly simplified.
  2. The number of AS levels is automatically computed.
  3. The input file has changed with this release. Cells are listed in a separate column from the children column.
  4. Biomarkers and references can now be added to any anatomical structure.
  5. The anytree Python module is required.
  6. A header is autogenerate in the output file.
  7. A DOT file can be generated to display the tree in Graphviz.
  8. Lots of tests to validate the input file.

## Assumptions

The following assumptions are built into the program.
  1. The ASCT+B table format allows anatomical structures that are not "leaves" to contain biomarkers or references.
  2. All anatomical structures must be uniquely named, for example, there can not be two structures called "ovary" but there can be "left ovary" and "right ovary".
  3. Cell type is only one level.
  3. Commas can not be used in names for anatomical structures, cells, or features.

## Data validation

The program performs the following data validation.
  1. make sure there's only one root anatomical structure
  2. make sure anatomical structures, cells, and biomarkers are appropriately defined
  3. make sure no two anatomical structures, cells, biomarkers, or references have the same name

## Requirements

This program has only been tested on a Mac OS using Python 3. Although it should work on a Linux system.

The program requires the anytree Python package.
```
https://pypi.org/project/anytree/

```
The anytree package can be installed as follows.
```
python3 -m pip install anytree --user
```

## Usage

```
usage: process.py [-h] [-d] [-v] input output

Generate ASCT+B table.

positional arguments:
  input          Input file
  output         Output file (TSV)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -d, --dot      Output tree as a DOT file for plotting with Graphviz.
  -v, --verbose  Print the tree to the terminal.
```

To process the demo input file and generate a TSV file that can be opened by Excel

```
process.py <input TSV file> <output TSV file>
```


```
process.py demo-input.txt demo-output.xls
```

## Input file (TSV)

The tab delimited file must contain a header line and the following twelve columns:

NAME (REF DOI)	LABEL (REF DETAILS)	ID (REF NOTES)	TYPE	CHILDREN	CELLS	GENES	PROTEINS	PROTEOFORMS	LIPIDS	METABOLITES	FTUs	REFERENCES

The **Type** value needs to be "AS" for anatomical structures and "CT" for cell types. It doesn't matter what type values are used for the other items, so long as it's not either AS or CT.

**Children** is a comma separated list of child anatomical structure (AS) objects. These children need to be either anatomical structures (AS). The **Cells**, **Genes**, **Proteins**, **Proteoforms**, etc fields should be comma separated lists of the appropriate objects (e.g., **Cells**, should be a comma separated list of relevant cells). In all cases the objects **Name** or **Ref DOI** should be used. 

The first line in the input file is assumed to contain a header and is ignored.

The following example is incomplete and just included to exemplify the field values and usage:

```

## Known problems and limitations

1. The program should validate the biomarkers using the TYPE field designation.
1. Export ASCT+B table as CSV file.
